# Tic Tac Toe - Project0

## Project Brief

### Technical Requirements

* :white_check_mark: Render a game board in the browser
* :white_check_mark: Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
* :white_check_mark: Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
* :white_check_mark: Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* :white_check_mark: Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
* :white_check_mark: Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* :white_check_mark: Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### Bonus Content Attepted

* :white_check_mark: Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
* :white_check_mark: Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up
* :white_check_mark: Use LocalStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity

### Necessary Deliverables
* :white_check_mark: A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
* :white_check_mark: A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repo
* :white_check_mark: A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* :white_check_mark: A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

## Code Discussion

### Psudo Code & Plan

* need $your_turn & $winner etc. variables 
* create board with css - table, rows and cells. 
* player turn as a boolean O = true, X = false 
* take turn - click on square 
* current player switches to next player and next player becomes the current player 
* error if player clicks on a cell already active 
* is the game over? 
* mark/change cell style (change class) to show as engaged 
* $winner based on the cell state - check all 4 directions 
* no? are there empty cells? next player, else there is a tie 

### Coding process

:speech_balloon: more to come.
